## Course Policies and Grading

### Attendance/Participation Expectations
- You are, of course, expected to participate in all class activities.
- Given that this is an online course, quizzes will be employed to collect attendance.
  - They will only be available until their due dates and won't be made available after the due dates passes.
- A MS Teams or a discord channel will be created for interacting with your fellow students. I won't be monitoring it but you can use it to seek help from your classmates.
- You will need to maintain a line of communication with me regarding your performance. Seek me out if you need help.

### Communication protocols
* I will post announcements on Canvas (make sure it‚Äôs connected to your email)
* For any communication with me, make sure you send me an email to [ben.leach@uc.edu](mailto:ben.leach@uc.edu) and to use your UC email.
* For any questions about the class material, please post that to the [Q&A Discussion Forum](https://uc.instructure.com/courses/1296712/discussion_topics/4407024); The TA and I will be monitoring the board and will get back to you as soon as possible.
  * Questions about code must include:
      * a code example (or link to code in GitHub)
      * what you are trying to do
      * and what you have already tried

* 10% will be deducted for every late day once the free pass has been used.
* Once a solution has been posted, no work for that assignment will be accepted.
    * you may suggest a different project to build that will illustrate your understanding.


#### Assignment Submission Workflow and Expectations
- Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
  - this will copy the starter files for the assignment to a repository named as `<assignment name>-<your github username>`
- Clone down the project to your computer.
- start modifying/writing your code to satisfy the assignment requirements.
- Make sure you commit your code frequently and use a descriptive commit messages.
  - the best practice here is to commit at the end of every complete thought. (i.e. `modified the user class to validate the age input`, `updated the self assessment in the README file`)
- Once you're done with the assignment, confirm that you've updated the self evaluation and added any notes or reflections you had.
- Copy the Repository link and submit to Canvas.

**Remember to:** make sure your code is on GitHub and you didn't just commit it locally.


### Grading
* The assignment grades will be calculated based on 3 inputs:
  * Your self assessment: You will need to give your self a grade and a justification on the `README.md` file of every assignment.
  * Automated tests.
  * TA reviewing your code and self assessment.

### Course Evaluation
The School of Information Technology requires that each course is evaluated each time it is taught.  The School uses a confidential web-based system, CoursEval, for these evaluations.  At the beginning of finals week,you will receive an email from the School Head, with ‚ÄúCoursEval‚Äù as the topic.  There is a link on that email that takes you directly to the evaluation.  The online system is anonymous.  I will receive only a summary report of combined data after final grades have been submitted.

As an instructor, I greatly value your input regarding the strengths and areas for improvement of this course.  Your feedback is essential for me to continually improve instruction and provide for quality student learning and outcomes.
