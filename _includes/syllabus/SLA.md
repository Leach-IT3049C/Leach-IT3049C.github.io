## Service Level Agreement

### Communication policies
* I will acknowledge/respond to all emails within 48 hours
* I will do office hours on an as-needed, appointment-based system. Use the link on the top to schedule a meeting with me or the TA.


### Late/Missing work
* I will not accept late or missing work. I am, however, dropping the lowest grades from your final grade.

### Feedback
* Assignments will be graded and returned within 10 days of the due date.
* Most of the assignments will be accompanied by a suite of automatic tests that can give you an early feedback on your work.
  * For the most part, passing tests means full grade, unless indicated otherwise.
