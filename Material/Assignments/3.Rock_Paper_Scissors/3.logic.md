# Implementing Game Logic

The Resources folder structure should look something like this.
```
resources
├── images
│   └── .gitkeep
├── scripts
│   ├── rock_paper_scissors.js ⬅️
│   └── index.js
└── styles
    └── styles.css
```
In this step, we will be working on the file marked with the ⬅️

In the `scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js`, we will make a `RockPaperScissors` class that will contain all logic for the game (properties and methods). and in the `scripts/index.js` file, we will handle the user input and call methods from the `RockPaperScissors` class as needed.

This file, we will use [JavaScript Classes](https://javascript.info/class).

## `RockPaperScissors` Class
The class will include a few properties:
* username
* score: {user: 0, cpu: 0}
* gameHistoryLog: []

This class will only contain 4 methods:
1. `constructor(username)`
2. `generateCPUResponse()`
3. `determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection)`
4. `play(userSelection)`

```js
class RockPaperScissors {
    constructor(username) {
        ...
    }

    generateCPUResponse() {
        ...
    }

    determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection){
        ...
    }

    play(userSelection) {
        ...
    }
}
```
Let's start with one function at a time...

### `constructor(username)`
This function will take in the `username` as a parameter and set it as a property to the class. In the constructor, we will also defined all our variables and set them to some initial values/
```js
class RockPaperScissors {
    constructor(username) {
        this.username = username;
        this.score = {
            user: 0,
            cpu:0 
        },
        this.gameHistoryLog = [];
    }
    ...
}
```
#### Note:
* class property are declared with the `this` keyword.

### `generateCPUResponse()`
For this function:
1. Create an array with the following values 
```js
const acceptedValues = [ `rock`, `paper`, `scissors` ]
```
2. Using both [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) and [Math.floor()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) methods, generate a random index number (0,1,2)
3. return the value of acceptedValue at the random index generated in the previous step.

### `determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection)`
This function will take 2 parameters `userSelection` and `cpuSelection` and will return one of the following values (`win`, `lose`, `tie`). 
* it would return (tie) if the user selection is the same as the cpu random selection.
* it would return (win) if:
    * user selection is `rock` and cpu selection is `scissors`
    * OR
    * user selection is `paper` and cpu selection is `rock`
    * OR 
    * user selection is `scissors` and cpu selection is `paper`
* it would return (lose) in any other case.

### `play(userSelection)`
This method takes in 1 parameter: the `userSelection`. It will:
* Get the CPU Random selection using the `generateCPUResponse()`
* Determine the winner using the `determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection)`
* update the score tally `this.score`
    ```js
        // if the user won the round
        this.score.user ++;
        // if the user cpu the round
        this.score.cpu ++;
    ```
    OR
    ```js
        this.score = {
            user: NEW_SCORE,
            cpu: NEW_SCORE
        }
    ```
* Add another historyLog entry to the game history array. 
    * the log entry should look something like this `Ben selected Scissors, CPU selected Paper: Ben wins wins`
    ```js
    this.gameHistoryLog.push(`Ben selected Scissors, CPU selected Paper: Ben wins wins`);
    ```

## Result
**Running the unit tests should pass**
